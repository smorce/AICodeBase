# Instructions

Your job is to self-check that the project setup is complete. Be sure to check that user requirements have been met. If there is no explicit request from the user, please make sure the comment on the last line of my code has been removed.

## Constraints

Please present the complete code, not abbreviated as in the existing code.

## Command Instructions

Please run the following code.
```code
file_paths = [
    'actions/example-actions.ts',
    'actions/stripe-actions.ts',
    'app/layout.tsx',
    'app/page.tsx',
    'app/(auth)/layout.tsx',
